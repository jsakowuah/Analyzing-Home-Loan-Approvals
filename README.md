# Analyzing-Home-Loan-Approvals
Exploratory and Predictive Data Analysis of the Loan Approval Processes of a financial firm called 'Comfort LLC.'

Background:

Comfort LLC is a finance company that specializes in all home-related loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan then, the company validates the customer's eligibility before the loan is granted.

Problem description:

The new management of Comfort LLC has informed Amir and Joseph, the firm’s data analyst team, to conduct exploratory and prescriptive analysis that will guide the company's decision to enhance its operations. The following are key to the company going forward.

Firstly, there is a need for data analysis to suggest methods to increase the profitability of the company. Specifically, management is considering offering more loans to applicants who are married or are living with family. Management presupposes that such applicants have the motivation to require more home loans and larger amounts hence an increase in the company’s profit in the long run. In addition, management will also require information regarding the category of applicants which were rejected by the old management. Comfort LLC is not sure if this is a good idea yet. Joseph and Amir would need to provide insights to guide a data-driven decision.

Secondly, Comfort LLC seeks to automate the process of approving the eligibility of a loan (in real-time) based on the customer's details provided while filling out the online application form. These details are:

Gender: Male / Female
Marital Status: Married - Yes or No
Education: Graduate / Not Graduate
Number of Dependents: 0,1,2 and +3
Income (USD).
Loan amount (USD in thousands).
Credit History.
Property's area: Rural / Urban / Semi-urban
Management has provided data identifying the customer segments eligible for loan amounts to target these customers specifically.

Research Objectives:

Exploratory Data Analysis

1. What are the demographics of previous successful loan applicants?
2. Do married people request more loans as compared to unmarried individuals? Which group request higher loans?
3. Do people with dependents request more loans than individuals without dependents? Which group request higher loans?
4. Which property area is preferred by the loan applicants?

Automating Loan Approval Process

Using marital and dependency status, build a model that automates the loan approval process by determining the applicant's eligibility.
